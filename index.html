              Vikings is a historical drama television series created and written by Michael Hirst for the History channel. Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. In January 2019, it was announced that the 20-episode sixth season, which was ordered on September 12, 2017, ahead of its fifth-season premiere, would be the final season of the series. The sixth season premiered on December 4, 2019. A sequel series, titled Vikings: Valhalla, is in development for Netflix.
            </p>
            <p>
              The series is inspired by the tales of the Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia. It broadly follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok and his crew, family and descendants, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagas Ragnars saga Loðbrókar and Ragnarssona þáttr, as well as in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th-century work Gesta Danorum. Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in the Norse oral tradition, written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode, or Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century account of the Varangians. The series begins at the start of the Viking Age, marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.

            <p>
              Ragnar Lodbrok or Lothbrok (Old Norse: Ragnarr Loðbrók, "Ragnar shaggy breeches", Modern Icelandic: Ragnar Loðbrók) is a legendary[1] Viking hero, as well as, according to the Gesta Danorum, a legendary Danish and Swedish king.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is known from Old Norse poetry of the Viking Age, Icelandic sagas, and near-contemporary chronicles. According to the traditional literature, Ragnar Lodbrok distinguished himself by many raids against the British Isles and the Holy Roman Empire during the 9th century.According to the sagas Ragnarssona þáttr and Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum, Ragnar Lodbrok's father was the legendary king of the Swedes, Sigurd Ring.

            <h4 class="heroes__name">Ladgerda</h4>
            <p>
              According to legend, Lagertha was a Viking shield-maiden and ruler from what is now Norway, and the onetime wife of the famous Viking Ragnar Lodbrok. Her tale was recorded by the chronicler Saxo in the 12th century. According to modern scholarship, it is likely that Lagertha was not a historical figure, but a reflection of tales about Viking warrior women or about the Norse deity Thorgerd.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ladgerda, a skilled Amazon, who, though a maiden, had the courage of a man, and fought in front among the bravest with her hair loose over her shoulders. All marvelled at her matchless deeds, for her locks flying down her back betrayed that she was a woman.

            <h4 class="heroes__name">Bjorn</h4>
            <p>
              Björn Ragnarsson or Bjorn Ironside is the King of Kattegat. He is the son of Ragnar and Lagertha and the oldest of Ragnar’s many sons. Although later it is revealed his uncle Rollo might be his biological father, Björn believes he is Ragnar's son.</p>
            <p>
              Björn was raised with the typical Northman conduct. He values his family and is devoted to both of his parents. Björn, since he was young, yearned to become a warrior like his parents; now old enough, Björn is more than ready to prove himself in battle. He shows extreme loyalty to his father even after years of separation. After returning from France he rallies the people to Ragnar's side and reminds them of where all their wealth and success has come from.
